This year's IWD theme, ‚ÄúInspire Inclusion,‚Äù aligns perfectly with the Women at AWS mission to strive to make AWS Earth‚Äôs best workplace and preferred employer for women.\n\nThe celebration kicked off with a welcome note from our CEO, Adam Selipsky, followed by an incredible panel discussion about the importance of gender diversity in tech and inclusive practices to support women. Moderated by Dilip Kumar, our community heard from AWS leaders Becky Weiss, Tanuja Randery, Nandini Ramani, and Kara Hartnett Hurst. We are grateful for the support of our CEO and leaders who contributed to the celebration.\n\nAlong with our leaders, the celebration provided a platform for over 20 incredible women builders that had unprecedented impact on our customers. Events like these, remind me how fortunate I am to work at a company that values diversity and inclusion. I am grateful to the Women at AWS leadership and community for continuing this important conversation.\n\nWhen we inspire inclusion, we raise the bar for everyone.\n\nHere is a picture with Adam and the most amazing volunteers, Livleen Kaur and Prerna Nayyar who made the Women at AWS International Women‚Äôs Day celebration a huge success!!\n\n#InspireInclusion #IWD2024 #womenataws "],

A serverless architecture enables you to quickly deploy your applications without needing to set up and manage compute servers to run your applications on, the maintenance of which can be another full-time job. In this course, you‚Äôll learn how to do this by using an event-driven architecture to build complex AI workflows.\n\nMike illustrate these concepts by building a cool application that automatically detects incoming customer inquiries, transcribes them with ASR (automatic speech recognition), summarizes them with an LLM using Amazon Bedrock, and deploys serverless with AWS Lambda.\n\nI hope this course makes it much easier for you to build and deploy LLM applications requiring multi-step AI workflows.

For those who may not know, a technical advisor is a unique role at our company. TAs shadow the CEO and provide technical advice and support, helping to push the business forward while removing roadblocks. \n\nLaura has had an impressive career here at Amazon, and by her own account embracing ambiguity and taking ownership has helped her thrive. One of the quotes that really stands out from Laura‚Äôs journey is this: ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre delivering the right things for your customers, you‚Äôll find that as you build the right products and programs, you‚Äôll also develop your career in exciting new ways.‚Äù \n\nI think you‚Äôll find the story of her career journey, and her advice, a valuable read.\nhttps://lnkd.in/gdeNSyYe"],
